This project is an adaptation of the tutorial "[React JS Portfolio Website Using Tailwind CSS - Build & Deploy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpZrAjU6Hhk&t=4141s)" by [Yash Patel](https://www.youtube.com/@yashpatel1O1). The tutorial provided valuable guidance that I used to create my version of the app.

I followed the structure and concepts from the tutorial, but adapted it to suit my project's requirements.
